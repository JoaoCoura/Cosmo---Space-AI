# Cosmo - Space AI

## High-Level Summary
Cosmo - Space AI is a virtual assistant designed to help students and the general public explore exoplanets and astronomy. Using natural language processing, the assistant provides clear answers to questions about exoplanets, celestial phenomena, and related scientific topics. It also features an interactive quiz to reinforce learning and check understanding.
The project focuses on user-friendly interaction, allowing users to either ask questions in their own words or choose from a list of pre-made questions. The main challenge it addresses is the need for accessible educational materials on exoplanets, especially for underserved communities and students with limited access to traditional resources. By creating an interactive platform that breaks down complex scientific ideas, Cosmo - Space AI encourages curiosity and exploration among users of different ages and backgrounds.
Its significance lies in making scientific knowledge more accessible. It enables learners to explore the universe at their own pace and fosters curiosity about space. By inspiring future scientists and enthusiasts, the project aims to create a more informed society that values science and exploration. Additionally, it supports NASA's mission to engage the public with space science, making the field of exoplanet research more relatable and inspiring.

## Project Details
Cosmo - Space AI is an interactive virtual assistant that answers users' questions about exoplanets, celestial phenomena, and related scientific concepts. It offers two main ways to interact:
Natural Language Queries: Users can ask questions in their own words and receive personalized responses.
Pre-Made Questions: A list of frequently asked questions is available for users who prefer structured queries, ensuring quick access to information.
The assistant uses Gemini's AI to understand user input and provide accurate answers based on a comprehensive information database. Users can type in specific topics they want to learn about, and Cosmo will respond accordingly. This setup allows users to explore various subjects related to exoplanets and astronomy at their own pace, helping them understand the universe better.
Cosmo - Space AI offers several benefits for learning about astronomy. It makes complex concepts easier to understand, appealing to a wide audience, including students and curious learners. Interactive elements like quizzes and custom questions encourage deeper exploration of topics and spark interest in space. The tool also supports educators by helping them create engaging lessons about exoplanets and astronomy, making it a useful classroom resource. By allowing users to choose between open-ended questions and pre-made ones, the assistant provides a more tailored learning experience.
The main goal of Cosmo - Space AI is to inspire curiosity and expand knowledge about exoplanets and astronomy, especially among underserved communities. By making scientific information accessible and engaging, the project seeks to foster a love for science and exploration in future generations.
Cosmo - Space AI was developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML for a user-friendly interface. The project was created in Visual Studio Code, which offered a suitable environment for coding and debugging. With these tools, Cosmo - Space AI encourages learning about the universe and helps users explore scientific concepts.
